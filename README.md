**BRIX** lets people receive Bitcoin using information they already know by heart — their phone number or email address. No new addresses to memorize, no QR codes to share, no invoices to generate.

> Your phone. Your email. Your Bitcoin.

## The Problem

Receiving Bitcoin on Lightning usually requires generating invoices, scanning QR codes, or sharing long addresses that no one can remember. These are technical barriers that keep normal people away from using Bitcoin in daily life.

## The Solution

BRIX maps **your phone number or email** — things you already use every day — to a Lightning payment endpoint. When someone wants to send you sats, they just need the contact info you already share with everyone.

### How it works

1. **Register with your phone or email** — the info you already know
2. **Verify ownership** — a one-time code confirms it's really yours
3. **Receive Bitcoin** — anyone can now send you sats using your contact info, from any Lightning wallet

No new identifiers to learn. No addresses to bookmark. Just the phone number or email you already give to people.

### Receiving payments

Anyone can send you sats from any Lightning wallet. They just use the address BRIX generates from your registration (e.g., `username@brix.brostr.app`).

## Integration

BRIX is designed as a standalone service that any app can integrate. It implements [LUD-16](https://github.com/lnurl/luds/blob/luds/16.md) (Lightning Address) and exposes a simple REST API for registration and verification.

Currently integrated with the [Bro App](https://brostr.app), but any application can connect to a BRIX server to offer Lightning Address services to its users.
